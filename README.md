# DSA-DA-SQL-Project
This is a documentation of the execution of the DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project on SQL.
## This is a Business Intelligence Analysis Project executed for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) Abuja Division, based on data from its business operations between 2009 and 2012
The .csv files used for this analysis - as obtained from the Company's database - contained information such as Customer details, Product details, order details, location, shipping details, price details and return status.

The .csv files were imported to **Microsoft SQL Management Studio** which was the tool used for the analysis.

Total number of unique product data was **8,399**
### Key Insights and Findings
From the business intelligence analysis conducted, the following insights, findings and recommendations were made:
1. **"Technology"** Product Category had the highest sales with the total sum of **5,984,248.182**. It was closely followed by "Furniture" with **5,178,590.542**, while "Office Supplies" came a distant third with **3,752,762.1**.
2. By sales volume, the top 3 Regions were **West** (with 3,597,549.276), **Ontario** (with 3,063,212.48) and **Prarie** (with 2,837,304.602) in that order, while the bottom 3 were **Yukon** (with 975,867.371), **Northwest Territories** (with 800,847.3295) and **Nunavut** (with 116,376.4835).
3. The total sales value of "Appliances" in Ontario alone was **202,346.84**.
4. From the total sales data of the bottom 10 customers (which summed up to 2,597.028 only), KMS management may want to consider a more robust discount offer to motivate them to engage in more purchases, thereby boosting company revenue - particularly via turnover.
5. The shipping method that cost KMS the most fortune was the **Delivery Truck** mode at 51,971.94.
6. The **Top 5** most valuable customers KMS had during the period under review were **Emily Phan, Deborah Brumfield, Roy Skaria, Sylvia Foulston and Grant Carroll**. It is not sufficiently clear what products they typically purchased, but the sum total of their patronage is worth 484,392.4865.
7. **Dennis Kane** is the "Small Business" customer with highest sales - valued at 75,967.5905.
8. The "Corporate" customer with the highest number of orders was **Adam Hart**, having placed a total of 27 orders.
9. The most profitable "Consumer" customer was **Emily Phan**. KMS made 34,005.44 from transaction caried out with this customer.
10. Only a total of **572** items were returned by customers.
11. Decision on what delivery/shipping mode to employ to send products across to customers is dependent on a number of factors icluding: order priorty, order quantity and location or delivery distance. KMS spent **51,971.94** shipping 1,146 orders via Truck Delivery *(averaging 45.35 per delivery)*, while spending **7,850.91** shipping 983 orders via Express Air *(averaging 7.99 per delivery)*. Although Express Air is a faster mode of delivery, available data shows that KMS spent less on this mode than on Truck Delivery mode. This could be owing to the fact that most orders made were within driving distance from KMS Abuja store, and their order priorities were not always "critical" or "high". Therefore, their expenditure pattern relating to shipping cost is justifiable, although better can be done at checkmating possible price inflations.
